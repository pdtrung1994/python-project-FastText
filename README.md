In this notebook, we'll implement a model that gets comparable results whilst training significantly faster and using around half of the parameters. 
More specifically, we'll be implementing the "FastText" model from the paper 
[Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759)."
